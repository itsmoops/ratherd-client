PUT is when you return the whole thing, PATCH you can just sent partial data

	.	Allow:GET, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS
	.	

Maybe keep the winner of each round on the screen and only swap out the loser

have the ability to save favorite pairings, and share them on FB
(for a user you would save a favorite pairing field which would presumably just store the two id fields)

do i need to make user profiles so people don’t spam the shit out of it?

later on implement a minimum “wins” count on top of the ratio algorithm 

but it would have to be implemented later on
initially it needs to be open i think
or maybe on the play screen
you have an option to "play all rathers"
or "play best"
and that filters for rathers with a win score of over 50 or whatever
and people who play all will kind of be like people who browse new on reddit
theres gonna be a lot of shit they have to sort through, but they will also be among the first to see new good content

what if
on the games main screen
there is a new tab
and an established tab
established tab means you have played over 10 rounds or something
OR
have a system in place so that if you lose your first 10 matches in a row you just get deleted from the system

maybe an automoderation thing
have a field called flagged as nonsense
and once that reaches a certain number
remove it
i dunno

start implementing tests
query params to send someone a url of a good comparison
